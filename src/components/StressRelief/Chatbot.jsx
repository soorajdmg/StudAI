    'hi': "Hi there! ðŸŒŸ What's on your mind about your studies? I'm here to help with anything from exam prep to managing stress!",
    'hey': "Hey! ðŸ‘‹ I'm excited to help you succeed! What can we work on together today?",

    // Stress and anxiety
    'stressed': "I hear you, and what you're feeling is completely valid. ðŸ’œ Stress is your mind's way of saying you care about your success! Try this: take 3 deep breaths, write down your top 3 priorities for today, and tackle just one small task. You don't have to carry everything at once. What's weighing on you most right now?",
    'anxious': "Anxiety before studying is so normal - it shows you care! ðŸ«‚ Here's a quick technique: the 4-7-8 breathing (inhale 4, hold 7, exhale 8). Also try the '5-4-3-2-1' grounding method: notice 5 things you see, 4 you can touch, 3 you hear, 2 you smell, 1 you taste. What specific topic is making you feel anxious?",
    'overwhelmed': "I completely understand that feeling. ðŸŒˆ When everything feels too much, try a 'brain dump': write down EVERYTHING on your mind for 5 minutes, then circle just 3 things you can actually do today. Remember: you're not behind, you're exactly where you need to be. What feels most urgent right now?",

'Try colorful mind maps, diagrams, and visual flashcards!' : user?.learningProfile === 'auditory' ? 'Record yourself explaining concepts, study with others, and use educational podcasts!' : user?.learningProfile === 'kinesthetic' ? 'Use hands-on activities, take movement breaks, and try studying in different locations!' : 'Mix visual, auditory, and hands-on approaches - variety is your superpower!'} What subject are you working on?`,
    'focus': "Focus struggles are so common - you're definitely not alone! ðŸŽ¯ Try the Pomodoro Technique (25 min study + 5 min break), create a distraction-free zone, and start with just 10 minutes if 25 feels too long. What's your biggest distraction right now?",
    'motivation': "You're here asking for help - that already shows incredible dedication! ðŸŒŸ Remember your 'why' - what made you start this journey? Every expert was once a beginner, and every small step matters. What subject are you working on? Let's break it into bite-sized wins!",

    // Encouragement
    'tired': "Rest is productive too! ðŸ˜´ Your brain consolidates memories during sleep, so taking breaks isn't lazy - it's strategic! Make sure you're drinking water, getting some sunlight, and honoring your body's needs. How have you been sleeping lately?",
    'failing': "Hey, you're not failing - you're learning! ðŸ’ª Every 'mistake' is data that helps you improve. What feels like failure today often becomes the foundation for tomorrow's success. What specific challenge can we tackle together?",
    'give up': "I hear how hard this feels right now. ðŸ«‚ But look how far you've already come! Sometimes we need to adjust our approach, not our goals. What if we made this easier for a bit? What's one tiny step you could take today?",

    // General encouragement
    'thanks': "You're so welcome! ðŸŒŸ I'm genuinely happy to support you. Remember, asking for help is a sign of strength, not weakness. I'm always here when you need encouragement or study strategies!",
    'bye': "Take care! ðŸŒˆ Remember: you're capable of amazing things, and I believe in you completely. Come back anytime you need support, motivation, or just want to share your wins! You've got this! ðŸ’ª",
